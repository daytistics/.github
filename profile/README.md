Productivity is not about more work, but about making smarter decisions. Data is the compass that shows us the most efficient path.

## About the Project
Every day, you make decisions that affect whether your day turns out good or bad. These choices are often made on impulse, and what seems like the best option might not always be the right one.  
<br />
**We’re here to help you change that.** At Daytistics, we believe data-driven decisions lead to better outcomes. Our self-hostable app helps you track your daily activities and visualize how they impact your well-being. By analyzing this data over time, you can discover which activities contribute to a good day and which ones don’t.  
<br />
**But why stop at the past when you can predict the future?** Our custom-trained AI models, based on your personal data, allow you to enter a hypothetical day and predict how it might affect your well-being. The AI filters out irrelevant activities and relationships, helping you focus on what truly matters.  
<br />
**Reflecting on the past is also important.** That’s why Daytistics includes a built-in diary, giving you a space to reflect on your day and understand your emotions better.
