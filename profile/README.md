Productivity is not about more work, but about making smarter decisions. Data is the compass that shows us the most efficient path.

## About the Project
Every day you make decisions that affect whether your day is good or bad. You probably make this decision on impulse, but what often seems like the best option is often not the best option.
<br>
**We can help you to change this** because we believe that data-driven decisions are the better option in most cases, so we want to offer you software that can help you identify which activities make for a good day and which ones make for a bad one. All you have to do is track your daily activities over time and we can visualize the relationships between your activities and your feelings. 
<br>
**But what good is the past without the future?** Best of all, we offer you the ability to look into the future with a custom-trained AI model based on your data. You can enter a hypothetical day and we can help you figure out if that day is good for you. Our AI also filters out relationships and activities that are irrelevant to the success of your day.
<br>
**Because the past is also interesting**, we also offer you a small diary to help you reflect on your day.

_AI features are only available to you if you provide us with enough information about your activities and daily achievements, have purchased the premium plan and have agreed to the use of your data for AI training._
